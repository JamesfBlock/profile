          <h2>CEO @ BanterBus</h2>
          <p>After competpng my A-Levels at Radley College in mid-2013 I moved to the South West and attended the University of Exeter where I studied Law. At University I was heavily involved with the entrepreneurial scene, participating in a number of inter-university events (SetSquared Partnership/ University of Exeter (Ignite)) being successful in many and sourcing funding for various projects. My interest in entrepreneurial-ism led to my increased involvement in the universities Entrepreneurs Society (VP). <a href="#C4">See what else I have been up to by clicking here.</a>
